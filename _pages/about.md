Hi, Thanks for stopping by! I'm a first year masters student at the Languages Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University junior machine learning engineer with a growing interest in Natural Language Processing research. I am co-advised by [Prof. Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/) and [Prof. Alan Black](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/) and currently based in [Neulab](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/). Currently, I am focusing on low resource natural language processing with a focus on machine translation and speech recognition.

Research Interests
======
* Natural language processing in general
* Machine Translation
* Named Entity Recognition
* Multilingual NLP
* Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis
